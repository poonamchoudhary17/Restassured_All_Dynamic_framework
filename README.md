# Restassured_All_Dynamic_framework
This project is created to automate the REST API of any type of method
This project is designed to automate various types of APIs, including SOAP and REST, primarily utilizing RestAssured, Apache POI, TestNG, and JSONPath.
Key features of the project include:
1)Automation of execution and validation of REST methods such as POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and GET, as well as SOAP methods.
2)Ability to construct request bodies using parameters extracted from an Excel file. The project includes a utility built with Apache POI for  data retrieval from Excel.
3)Implementation of data-driven  concepts, dividing the project into four packages: "api method," "request repository," "test classes," and "dynamic driver classes."
4)Test execution driven by dynamic driver classes, allowing all test classes execution together.
With these capabilities, the project provides comprehensive automation for API testing.
